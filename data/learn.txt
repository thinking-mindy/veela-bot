Introduction
You have an opportunity for a better paying job, but you need to
improve your English before you can apply. Or, you want to enroll in a
university in the United States, but your English is not good enough yet.
You have already taken English classes for two years in secondary
school. Maybe you have studied more English at the university. You
know English grammar and can write, but you need to learn how to
speak English.
And you need to improve your spoken English very quickly.
This book will tell you how to retrain your mind—and your
tongue—in order to learn fluent spoken English.
With the information from this book, you can learn to speak English
in half of the time it normally takes.
In the Spoken English Learned Quickly course, we try to follow the
same pattern with other types of English words. It is far easier to learn
big, bigger, and biggest, or angry, angrier, angriest, and angrily as cog-
nate groups than it is to learn them as individual vocabulary words. Not
only is it easier to remember bad, worse, worst, and badly as a group,
but their meaning is better understood because they are logically related
to each other. The greatest advantage, however, is that this method
teaches students how the English language is developed. When stu-
dents know big, bigger, and biggest, they can then develop the word
tallest if they know only the word tall. The real essence of language
fluency is understanding that language well enough to intuitively use
new vocabulary during actual conversation.
All of the above comments relate to spoken language. You may find
it helpful to organize words in table form. But you must learn to use
the words in the context of spoken language, not merely written tables.
Four types of verb drills
In the Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons we use four verb
table formats. All verb tables are used as spoken English drills with
recorded audio. In the early lessons, we use only the following format
which I will call an "A" format verb drill:
1. An "A" format English verb drill.
TO CALL (to call) / He promised to call. (He promised to call.)
Call. (Call.) / Please call. (Please call.)
calling (calling) / It is calling. (It is calling.)
called (called) / it is called (it is called) / it was called (it was
called) / it will be called (it will be called)
• I call (I call) / he calls (he calls) / she calls (she calls) / it
calls (it calls) / you call (you call) / we call (we call) / they
call (they call)
• I called (I called) / he called (he called) / she called (she
called) / it called (it called) / you called (you called) / we
called (we called) / they called (they called)
• I will call (I will call) / he will call (he will call) / she will call
(she will call) / it will call (it will call) / you will call (you will
call) / we will call (we will call) / they will call (they will call)
Since all of our exercises are recorded audio lessons, you would re-
spond by repeating the words inside parentheses. We provide a 450-
page Student Workbook which contains the written text for all spoken
drills. The parenthetical phrases are included in the written text. Thus,
the narrator says, "to call" and you would respond, "to call." The narra-
tor says, "He promised to call." and you would respond, "He promised
to call." Everything is spoken, and as soon as you would understand a
new exercise, you would put the written text aside and complete the
exercise by using only the audio recording without the text.
Repeated use of this format is what allows our students to conjugate
an unknown verb correctly. Can you see the fluency they have acquired
when they can correctly use English verbs so early in their language
learning experience? That is the same fluency you will want to develop
as you study English.
Quite early in the lesson series, we use another verb table format.
Throughout our Student Workbook, all irregular verb forms are written
in bold type. A drill for the irregular verb "to meet" looks like this:
2. A sentence completion English verb drill.
Complete the following sentences with " . . . them here every evening."
I always meet . . . (I always meet them here every evening.) / He always
meets . . . (He always meets them here every evening.) / You always
meet . . . (You always meet them here every evening.) / We always
meet . . . (We always meet them here every evening.) / They always
meet . . . (They always meet them here every evening.)
Complete the following sentences with " . . . them here after work."
I always met . . . (I always met them here after work.) / She always met
. . . (She always met them here after work.) / You always met . . . (You
always met them here after work.) / We always met . . . (We always

met them here after work.) / They always met . . . (They always met
them here after work.)
Complete the following sentences with " . . . them all before evening."
I will meet . . . (I will meet them all before evening.) / She will meet .
. . (She will meet them all before evening.) / You will meet . . . (You
will meet them all before evening.) / We will meet . . . (We will meet
them all before evening.) / They will meet . . . (They will meet them
all before evening.)
Though the sentences are simple, this format teaches the verb con-
jugation in the context of the spoken language. It also forces the stu-
dents to be more mentally alert during the exercise. Later in the Spo-
ken English Learned Quickly lessons, we add a third type of verb
table which I am identifying here as a "B" format table. It looks like
this:
3. "B" format English verb drill.
TO TEST (to test) / He promised to test it. (He promised to test it.)
Test. (Test.) / Please test it. (Please test it.)
testing (testing) / He is testing some. (He is testing some.)
tested (tested) / it is tested (it is tested) / it was tested (it was
tested) / it will be tested (it will be tested)
I test (I test) I tested (I tested) I will test (I will
test)
he tests (he tests) he tested (he tested) he will test (he
will test)
she tests (she tests) she tested (she tested) she will test
(she will test)
it tests (it tests) it tested (it tested) it will test (it will
test)
you test (you test) you tested (you tested) you will test
(you will test)
we test (we test) we tested (we tested) we will test (we
will test)
they test (they test) they tested (they tested) they will test
(they will test)
In this format, we force the students to move from tense to tense us-
ing the same person, rather than from person to person using the same
tense as we did in the A format drills. Language requires both skills, so
we teach the students to do both at normal conversation speed.
However, by this time in the lessons we want the students to be able
to do both. Consequently, we alternate between table formats in the
same exercise. That is, the first verb is given using the A format, the
second verb using the B format, the third verb using the A format, the
fourth using the B format, and so on to the end of the exercise. This
increases the students' ability to use the verb with all tenses and persons
while, at the same time, forcing them to develop spontaneity while us-
ing the verb.
You are reading this book because you want to learn to speak fluent
English. I trust it will help you. Most of all, I think our freely
downloadable Spoken English Learned Quickly course on
www.FreeEnglishNow.com will be of benefit to you.
It is the world's most widely used spoken English language course,
and it is helping hundreds of thousands of students around the world
learn English very quickly. If you lived in the United States, for each
hour of study, Spoken English Learned Quickly would help you learn
to speak English twice as fast as you could learn spoken English in a
college English class. However, it is much more difficult to learn to
speak English fluently in a country where English is seldom used. If
you live in a country where you do not regularly hear properly pro-
nounced, grammatically correct English, Spoken English Learned
Quickly could help you learn to speak English in even less than half of
the time it normally takes in your country.
However, even though the course is free on the internet, it will still
cost you a great deal to learn to speak fluent English. It will cost you
time and a great deal of personal discipline. There will also be the cost
of changing your method of studying English. You must stop wasting
your time on English grammar and writing lessons and practice spoken
English instead—even when others tell you that in order to learn to
speak English well, you must study English grammar and writing. (Has
studying English grammar really helped you speak English fluently?)
Chapter Summary: This chapter will encourage you to be per-
sistent in studying spoken English. Staying at the task will be
your greatest difficulty.
This chapter will also encourage you to improve your spoken
English fluency by reading newspapers. The chapter closes by
telling you that you can expect success as you study spoken
English.
Learning to speak any new language is a difficult task. But it is not
impossible. The Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons will make it
much easier for you.
However, language learning always seems to move in steps. You
will study for a period of time and then reach a plateau where it seems
as though you are not making further progress. Then, suddenly, you
will realize that you have once more made excellent progress. Then,
for a time, it will again seem as though nothing is happening.
This is a normal process. These stair steps in spoken English fluency
will be much more exaggerated to you than they will be to those who
speak English as their first language. If you are studying diligently, they
will undoubtedly hear regular progress in your ability to speak, even
when you think nothing is happening.
Be persistent! You can learn to speak English fluently if you work
diligently.

LEARNING SPOKEN ENGLISH tells you how to learn to speak
English in half the time it would require in even the best
grammar-based English training programs. If you live in a
country where good English is not regularly spoken, for each
hour of study you can learn how to speak in even less than half
the time it will take others in your country.
This entirely new language study method for learning spoken
English works extremely well. It was first introduced on the
website www.FreeEnglishNow.com. Within two years, it had
become the world’s most widely distributed spoken English
language course. Today, hundreds of thousands of students
around the world are learning fluent spoken English using the
Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons from the website.
This book completely explains this new language study
method which is called the Feedback Training Method (also
known as the Proprioceptive Language Learning Method). You
can now learn English—or any other language—faster and with
greater fluency using this new method.
This book will help you learn English more quickly if you are
already studying in another English program. You may also use
the freely downloadable Spoken English Learned Quickly
lessons from www.FreeEnglishNow.com whether you are a
beginner or advanced English student.
We wish you the best of success as you learn to speak fluent
English.
