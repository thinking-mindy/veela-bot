Introduction
You have an opportunity for a better paying job, but you need to
improve your English before you can apply. Or, you want to enroll in a
university in the United States, but your English is not good enough yet.
You have already taken English classes for two years in secondary
school. Maybe you have studied more English at the university. You
know English grammar and can write, but you need to learn how to
speak English.
And you need to improve your spoken English very quickly.
This book will tell you how to retrain your mind—and your
tongue—in order to learn fluent spoken English.
With the information from this book, you can learn to speak English
in half of the time it normally takes.
Throughout this book, I will emphasize spoken English.
Chapter 1: Teaching Your Tongue to Speak English explains the con-
cept on which this Spoken English Learned Quickly method is built.
The remaining chapters tell you how to apply that information as you
learn to speak English fluently.
I wish you the best of success as you study spoken English.
Chapter 1: Teaching Your Tongue to Speak English
If you want to learn to speak English fluently, it will help you to
understand how the human mind produces speech.
However, before looking at the mechanics of speech, I want to draw
an analogy from machine control because the analogy closely parallels
neurological responses in spoken language.
Open-loop machine control
Wikipedia describes an open-loop control system as follows:
An open-loop controller, also called a non-
feedback controller, is a type of controller
which computes its input into a system using
only the current state . . . of the system. A
characteristic of the open-loop controller is
that it does not use feedback to determine if
its input has achieved the desired goal. This
means that the system does not observe the
output of the processes that it is
Chapter Summary: Speech is controlled in your mind by feed-
back from your hearing and mouth position as much as it is from
your memory. If you want to speak fluent English, it is just as im-
portant to retrain your tongue as it is to train your memory. To be
effective, however, you must retrain your mind, tongue, and hear-
ing at exactly the same time because they must work together
when you speak English.
Why have you studied English so long in school without learn-
ing to speak fluently? It is because your teachers have tried to
train your mind with written exercises without retraining your
tongue at the same time.
controlling. Consequently, a true open-loop
system . . . cannot correct any errors that
it could make.
For example, a sprinkler system, programmed
to turn on at set times could be an example
of an open-loop system if it does not measure
soil moisture as a form of feedback. Even if
rain is pouring down on the lawn, the
sprinkler system would activate on schedule,
wasting water.
Figure 1 shows an
open-loop control
system. The control
may be a simple
switch, or it could be a
combination of a
switch and a timer.
Yet, all it can do is
turn the machine on. It
cannot respond to
anything the machine
is doing.
Closed-loop machine control
Wikipedia then describes closed-loop control as follows:
To avoid the problems of the open-loop
controller, control theory introduces
feedback. A closed-loop controller uses
feedback to control states or outputs of a
dynamical system. Its name comes from the
information path in the system: process
inputs (e.g. voltage applied to a motor) have
an effect on the process outputs (e.g.
velocity . . . of the motor), which is
measured with sensors and processed by the
controller; the result (the control signal)
is used as input to the process, closing the
loop.
Open-Loop Control

Wikipedia's definition of a closed-loop system subsequently
becomes too technical to use here. However, as Wikipedia suggests
above, a sprinkler incorporating a soil moisture sensor would be a
simple closed-loop system. The sprinkler system would have both a
timer and a control valve. Either could operate independently, and either
could shut the water off, but both would need to be open in order for the
sprinkler to operate. The arrangement is shown in Figure 2.
If the soil is already moist, the sprinkler will remain off whether or
not the timer is open. When the moisture probe senses dry soil, the valve
is opened. However, after the sprinkler is on, if the soil becomes moist
enough, the valve will close even if the timer is still open. Thus, the
sprinkler uses feedback from its own operation to control itself.
Figure 3 shows a simple
closed-loop machine
control.
Notice that Figure 3 also
shows a calibration
function. Irrespective of
whether it is a soil moisture
sensor on a sprinkler—or a
counter on a machine—
there must be some way of
setting the control so that it
wi l l r e sp on d in a
predetermined way. In a Figure 3: A closed-loop machine control.

machine application, the calibration function could be a counter which
is set so that the machine will produce a certain number of finished
parts.
Human speech is a closed-loop system
Human speech is a complex learned skill and is dependent on a
number of memory and neurological functions. Speech is a closed-loop
system because sensors within the system itself give feedback to the
control portion of the system. The control then corrects and coordinates
ongoing speech. In this case, the mind is in control of the closed-loop
system, the mouth produces the desired product (speech), and auditory
feedback from the ears and feedback from the nerve sensors in the
mouth allow the mind to coordinate the speech process in real time. [1]
When you speak your own language, your mind stores all of the
vocabulary you need. Your mind also controls your tongue, mouth, and
breathing. Your hearing is also an important part of the control because
your ears hear everything your mouth says. Therefore, what you say
next is partially dependent on the vocabulary and other information
stored in your mind. But what you say next is also dependent on what
your ears are hearing your mouth say, and on the feedback that is
coming from the nerves in your tongue and mouth.
Because you have spoken your own language all of your life, all of
this control is automatic—you do not need to think about it. But when
you learn to speak English, you must retrain all of these processes so
that they will all work together at the same time. It is not enough to
simply put new vocabulary words or grammar drills into your memory.
You must retrain your mind to use all of the new sounds your ears will
hear, as well as the new movements of your tongue, mouth, and
breathing. Yet, since all of these things must happen together for you to
speak fluent English, all retraining of your memory, hearing, and the
nerves in your mouth must be done simultaneously.
The inter-relationship of these functions is shown in the table below.
The meanings of specialized words are given below the table.

Auditory and proprio-

Proprioceptive. [2] Human speech would be impossible without the
proprioceptive sense. (Proprioceptive refers to the sense within the
organism itself which detects or controls the movement and location of
the muscles, tendons, and joints which are used to create speech.) Our
mouth, vocal cords, diaphragm, and lungs incorporate thousands of
nerve sensors which the brain uses to control the movement and
position of these same organs—the mouth, vocal cords, diaphragm, and
lungs. Imagine the complexity of pronouncing even a single word with
Teaching Your Tongue to Speak English 5
the need to coordinate the tongue, breath control, and jaw muscles.
Now multiply this complexity exponentially as sentences are
constructed in rapid succession during normal speech.
Real time. Unlike an open-loop control system, a closed-loop control
system monitors feedback and corrects the process as the machine is
running. The reciprocal path between the control, the feedback sensors,
and the process itself is instantaneous. That is, information is not stored
for later use. Rather, it is used instantaneously as the sensors detect it.
In this chapter, I use the term simultaneous to indicate real time
feedback during speech.
Calibration. In human speech, the mind must constantly monitor the
feedback information from both the speaker's own hearing and the
proprioceptive senses which enable the mind to control muscles and
create the desired sounds. Thus, the speaker is constantly "calibrating"
the feedback to control speech. To change a tense, the speaker may
change "run" to "ran," or change the person from "he" to "she," and so
on. These "word" changes are achieved by precise control of the
muscles used to produce speech.
We "calibrate" our speech frequently as we talk. This is why we can
misuse a word, verb tense, or some other part of the initial sentence,
and still make corrections in the remaining words of the sentence so
that the listener does not hear our mistake.
Thus, in Figure 4, human speech is represented as the interplay
between the mind, the mouth, and its related organs (represented in the
figure by the tongue), two feedback systems, and conscious calibration
as the speaker constructs each sentence. In addition, calibration is
continuously taking place within the control center—the mind.
However, because it is acting on feedback from hearing and the
proprioceptive senses, I am showing calibration as acting on the source
of the feedback.
When children learn their mother tongue, their natural ability to hear
and mimic adult speech builds complex proprioceptive response
patterns. A French-speaking child effortlessly learns to make nasal
sounds. An English-speaking child learns to put her tongue between her
teeth and make the "th" sound. A Chinese-speaking child learns to
mimic the important tones which change the meaning of words. Each of
these unique sounds requires learned muscle control within the mouth.
I make no apology for the intricacy of this explanation. The
neurological feedback and resulting control of the muscles involved in
6 Learning Spoken English
speech is extremely complex. The mind is involved in a far greater task
than simply remembering vocabulary and organizing words into
meaningful sentences.
If you are learning English as a new language, all of its unique
sounds and syntax must be learned. This is much more than a memory
function involving just your mind. Each of these new sound and syntax
patterns requires retraining your entire mind, the nerve feedback in your
tongue, mouth, and breathing (which is proprioceptive feedback), and
the auditory feedback (your sense of hearing).
Even English syntax is dependent on your proprioceptive sense. The
statement, "This is a book," feels different to the nerve receptors in your
mouth than the question, "Is this a book?" We can certainly understand
that memory is involved in the use of correct grammar. Just as
important, however, is the observation that proprioceptive feedback
demands that a question evoke a different sequence of feedback than a
statement. This is why I have identified partial syntax control in Table 1
as being a shared function of both the mind (memory) and the mouth
(as a proprioceptive sense).

If you doubt that the proprioceptive sense is an important part of
speech, try this experiment. Read two or three sentences written in your
own language. Read it entirely in your mind without moving your lips.
You may even speed read it. Now read the same sentences "silently" by
moving your lips without making any sound. Your mind will respond to
the first way of reading as simple information which is primarily a
memory function, but will respond to the second way as speech because
of the proprioceptive feedback from your mouth.
Did you also notice a difference between the two readings in terms
of your mental intensity? The first reading would elicit the mental
activity required when you do a written grammar-based English
assignment. The second would result in the same kind of mental
activity required when you study English using spoken drills. How
quickly you learn to speak fluent English will be directly proportional
to your mental involvement when you study.
The best way to learn English
Two skill areas must be emphasized if you want to learn to speak
English fluently. The first is memory (which is involved in both
vocabulary and syntax) and the second is proprioceptive responses
(which are involved in both pronunciation and syntax).
You may be able to learn simple vocabulary-related memory skills
with equal effectiveness by using either verbal or visual training
methods. That is, you may be able to learn pure memory skills equally
well with either spoken drills or written exercises.
However, it is impossible for you to retrain your proprioceptive
sense without hearing your own voice at full speaking volume. Thus, in
my opinion, it is a waste of your time to do written assignments for the
purpose of learning spoken English.
Surprisingly, it will take far less time for you to learn both fluent
spoken English and excellent English grammar by learning only spoken
English first, than it will for you to study written English grammar
lessons before you can speak English. This does not mean, however,
that grammar is not a necessary part of spoken English instruction. It is
impossible to speak English—or any other language—without correct
use of its grammar. My statement simply means that the best way to
learn English grammar is through spoken English exercises. (See
Chapter 3: Grammar and Writing in Spoken English Study.)

proprioceptive sense of the mouth, the combined feedback from the

Simply said, the student must speak out loud for optimum spoken
language learning.

grammar-based English instruction has traditionally done by
introducing grammar, listening, writing, and reading as segregated
activities. It is not surprising that you have studied English so long in
school without learning to speak fluently.
Grammar-based instruction has hindered English learning by
segregating individual areas of study. This segregation is represented in
Figure 6. Grammar-based English training has not only isolated
proprioceptive training areas so that it prevents simultaneous skill
development, it has replaced it with visual memory training by using
written assignments. Grammar-based language instruction teaches
English as though spoken English was an open-loop system. The result
for the student is that, gaining English fluency requires far more study
time, pronunciation is often faulty, and grammar becomes more
difficult to learn.

Conclusion.
Why has it taken you so long to learn to speak English fluently?
Grammar-based English language instruction teaches as though
spoken English is primarily a function of memory. Consequently,
grammar-based English lessons emphasizes non-verbal (written) studies
of grammar, writing, reading, and listening. All of these activities may
increase recall memory for written examinations, but they have little
benefit in teaching you to speak fluent English.
The only way you can effectively learn spoken English is by using
spoken English as the method of instruction. All of your study
(including English grammar) should be done by speaking English at full
voice volume for the entire study period.
[1] Some researchers think human speech is an open-loop system. However,
it has been shown that the human brain does many things using both open–
and closed-loop control. As suggested in this chapter, spoken English
learning would be improved using spoken English study irrespective of
whether speech control is open– or closed-loop.
[2] The terms Proprioceptive Method and Feedback Training Method may
be used interchangeably in describing this language learning method. An
earlier term, Proprio-Kinesthetic Method, was also used for this same
language program. I will use the term proprioceptive to describe the
neurological process but will call the language learning method the
Feedback Training Method.
Chapter 2: Four Rules for Learning Spoken English
There are four simple rules you must follow when you are learning
to speak English:
1. To learn to speak English correctly, you must speak it aloud.
It is important that you speak loudly and clearly when you are
studying spoken English. You are retraining your mind to respond
to a new pattern of proprioceptive and auditory stimuli. This can
only be done when you are speaking aloud at full volume.
One of the reasons that your English study in school required so
much time while producing such poor results is that none of the si-
lent study did anything to train your tongue to speak English.
2. To learn to speak English fluently, you must think in English.
The proprioceptive sense is not all that you are retraining when
you learn spoken English. There is cognitive learning (memory)
which must also take place. Grammar-based English instruction has
emphasized cognitive learning to the exclusion of retraining the pro-
prioceptive sense. Nonetheless, cognitive learning is an important
part of learning to speak English fluently.
For speech to occur, your mind must be actively involved in syn-
tax development. The more actively your mind is involved in spo-
ken English, the more effective the learning process becomes.
Chapter Summary: This chapter explains four rules which you
must follow in order to learn spoken English. These four rules
help you retrain your mind and tongue simultaneously so that you
will learn to speak fluent English quickly.
You will be surprised by the fourth rule which states, "You
must never make a mistake when you are speaking English."
However, just as you will hinder proprioceptive training by trying
to study silently, so you will also limit cognitive learning by reading
from a text rather than constructing the syntax in your own mind. If
you are studying English with Spoken English Learned Quickly,
you may use the written text when you first study a new exercise.
However, after repeating the exercise two or three times, you must
close the text and do the exercise from recall memory as you listen
to the audio recording. You must force your mind to think in Eng-
lish by using your recall memory when you are studying spoken ex-
ercises. You cannot read from a text.
I will come back to this later in Chapter 5: Selecting a Text, be-
cause there will be times when reading from a text such as a newspa-
per is an effective language learning tool. But when you are doing
sentence responses with recorded exercises, you must force your
mind to develop the syntax by doing the exercise without reading
from a text.
You are not thinking in English if you are reading. Making your
mind work in order to think of the response is an important part of
learning to speak English.
3. The more you speak English aloud, the more quickly you will learn
to speak it fluently.
Proprioceptive retraining is not instantaneous. It will require a
great deal of repetition to build the new language patterns in your
mind. As these new patterns develop, there will be progression from
a laborious, conscious effort, to speech which is reproduced rapidly
and unconsciously.
When you speak your first language, you do so with no conscious
awareness of tongue or mouth position and the air flow through the
vocal cords. In contrast, it requires experimentation and conscious
effort when you first attempt to make an unknown discrete sound in
English—this single sound, usually represented by one letter, is
called a phoneme. Some new sounds will be relatively simple for
you to make. Others will be more difficult.
To add to the complexity, each phoneme has other phonemes or
stops adjacent to it which change its sound slightly. (A stop is a
break caused by momentarily restricting the air flow with the tongue
or throat.) For example, the simple English sentence, "Why didn't
Four Rules for Learning Spoken English 13
that work?" may be difficult for you to pronounce if your language
does not use the English "th" sound. But it may give you difficulty
for another reason as well. There are actually two stops in the sen-
tence. When properly pronounced, there is a stop between the "n"
and "t" in "didn't" and another stop between the final "t" in "didn't"
and the first "t" in "that." Even though the sentence may be said
very quickly, the two stops would make it, "Why didn / t / that
work?"
Your objective is not to be able to write the sentence, "Why didn't
that work?" accurately in English. Your goal is not even to be able
to say it just well enough so that someone could figure out what you
meant. Your objective is to be able to say, "Why didn't that work?"
so perfectly to an American that she would think she had just been
asked the question by a fellow American.
That degree of perfection will require thousands—if not tens of
thousands—of repetitions. Therefore—to be somewhat facetious—
the more quickly you correctly repeat a particularly difficult pho-
neme ten thousand times, the more quickly you will be able to use it
fluently. That is what I mean when I say, "The more you speak Eng-
lish aloud, the more quickly you will learn to speak fluently."
4. You must never make a mistake when you are practicing spoken
English.
When you are learning spoken English using the Spoken English
Learned Quickly method, you are strongly reinforcing the learning
process each time you speak. However, when you construct a sen-
tence incorrectly, you have not only wasted the learning time used to
construct that sentence, but you must now invest even more time in
order to retrain your mind, mouth, and hearing in order to construct
the sentence correctly. The more you use a sentence structure incor-
rectly, the longer it will take for your mind, mouth, and hearing to
identify the correct syntax.
Ideally, if you used only correct syntax and pronunciation, you
could retrain your speech in considerably less time. Consequently,
you would learn to speak fluent English more quickly.
Yet, before you conclude that this would be impossible, let's look
at a way in which it can actually be done using the Spoken English
Learned Quickly language course. (Well, it can almost be done!)
14 Learning Spoken English
Four Rules for Learning Spoken English 15
Traditional English study
Traditional methods of teaching English attempt to engage the stu-
dents in free speech as quickly as possible. Though the goal is com-
mendable, in practice it has a serious drawback. A beginning student
does not have enough language background to be able to construct sen-
tences properly. More to the point, the instruction program seldom has
enough teachers to correct every student's errors. Consequently, begin-
ning students regularly use incomplete sentences having incorrect syn-
tax and verb construction. The instructor often praises them for their
valiant effort, in spite of the reality that they are learning to use English
incorrectly. The student will now need to spend even more time re-
learning the correct syntax.
Controlled language study
The better alternative is to derive all initial spoken language study
from audio recorded materials which contain perfect syntax, perfect use
of the verb, and perfect pronunciation. This sounds restrictive, but, in
fact, it can be done with the Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons.
Say, for example, that during the first two weeks of English study,
you used only the Spoken English Learned Quickly recorded exer-
cises. You would repeat the recorded lesson material which was accu-
rate in every detail. For the entire instruction period, you would work
by yourself while repeating the exercise sentences hundreds of times.
Needless to say, in two weeks' time, you would have spoken English
correctly far more than had you been passively sitting in a traditional
English class. But more to the point, everything you would have
learned would have been correct. Your syntax would have been cor-
rect. Your use of the English verb would have been correct. And, as
much as possible, your pronunciation would have been correct.
To continue the example, say that it was now time for you to begin
trying free speech. Yet, we still would not want you to make mistakes.
Consequently, all free speaking would be taken directly from the many
sentences you would have already learned. Your teacher would ask
questions from the Spoken English Learned Quickly exercises so that
you could answer in the exact words of the sentences you would have
studied. Subsequently, you would be given questions to answer which
would use the same structure as the sentences you already knew, but
now you would substitute other vocabulary words which would be in
the same lessons.
Making the application
I assume that you are a college student or a young professional and
that you are highly motivated to learn to speak English fluently.
You will do much better if you seek ways in which you can speak
English correctly from the very beginning. Strike a careful balance be-
tween free speech and forcing yourself to follow a pattern of correct
English use. Do everything in your power to use English correctly.
In the early weeks of English study, this may require that you spend
more time repeating recorded Spoken English Learned Quickly exer-
cises than in trying to engage in free speech. Later, however, you will
need to spend a great deal of time talking with others.
Nonetheless, every time you encounter new syntax in English, use
controlled language drills long enough so that your mind becomes thor-
oughly familiar with correct sentence structure and pronunciation. If
you are using the Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons, repeat the
exercises until you can say them quickly and accurately with perfect
pronunciation. As you progress in your English study, begin reading
English newspaper articles aloud. Look for examples of new vocabu-
lary and sentence format. Mark the sentences, verify the vocabulary,
and then read—and repeat from recall memory—the sentences aloud
until they become a part of your speech.
16 Learning Spoken English
My personal experience
I had the great advantage of growing up in a home in which gram-
matically correct English was spoken. As I progressed through pri-
mary school and on into secondary school, my language ability ma-
tured as a result of my home and school environments.
In retrospect, I believe this is what happened: for the most part, I
used proper sentence structure and pronunciation because that is what
I heard in my home. However, when I went to school, I needed to
learn grammar. I—like probably most of my classmates—did not
learn to speak because I studied grammar. Rather, I was able to learn
how to do grammar exercises because I already knew how to speak.
Certainly, I learned many important things about English through
grammar study. But it was of importance to me only because I had
already achieved basic English fluency. I did not learn to speak Eng-
lish as a result of English grammar lessons.
I also took two years of Spanish in secondary school. We started
with basic grammar. We wrote exercises every day. But we almost
never heard spoken Spanish, much less spoke it ourselves. After sec-
ondary school graduation, I could neither speak Spanish, nor did I un-
derstand Spanish grammar.
Within 10 years of my secondary school graduation, I spent a year
in Paris studying French. I had the great fortune of enrolling in a
Chapter Summary: Any language is unintelligible without
grammar because grammar consists of the rules used to put
words together in ways which convey meaning. The issue is not
whether or not you need to know English grammar. The ques-
tion is, "How do you learn English grammar best?"
Chapter 3: Grammar and Writing in Spoken English
18 Learning Spoken English
French language school that emphasized spoken French to the complete
exclusion of written exercises. Not only did I learn French
grammar—meaning that I learned to use sentences that communicated
what I intended to say to a French listener—but because French and
Spanish verb construction is similar, I also began to understand the
Spanish grammar which made no sense to me in secondary school. Be-
cause I could read and write in English, I had no difficulty reading
French. It was a simple transfer of knowledge from reading in English
to reading in French.
Later, I studied an African language. Because school-based language
courses were almost non-existent in that country, all of my language
training was done by way of recorded language drills that I adapted
from local radio broadcasts. I also had a university student as my lan-
guage helper. Yet, I learned how to structure a sentence (which is ap-
plied grammar) and write in that language much more quickly than had
I been studying grammar and writing independently of the spoken
language.
Traditional English instruction
Traditional English instruction for non-English-speaking students
has reversed the process with poor results. Most English classes teach
grammar as a foundation for spoken English.
The quickest way to teach students to read English is to teach them
to speak it first. The fastest way to teach them sufficient grammar to
pass college entrance exams is to build a foundation by teaching them
to speak English fluently. Whenever the process is reversed, it takes a
needlessly long time to succeed in teaching grammar and writing skills,
much less fluent spoken English.
If you are in a school that is using the Spoken English Learned
Quickly lessons and the instructors are also trying to teach supplemen-
tary grammar lessons, your progress will be hindered. The fastest way
for you to learn excellent English grammar is to learn it while speaking.
Every sentence you speak in this Spoken English Learned Quickly
course will teach you grammar. When you have repeated the sentences
enough times so that they sound correct to you, you will have learned
English grammar. The Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons are
full of grammar. But the grammar is learned by speaking, not by
writing.
Grammar and Writing in Spoken English Study 19
Do not misunderstand what I am saying. You cannot speak any lan-
guage well without knowing its grammar because grammar consists of
the rules used to put words together into meaningful sentences. In Eng-
lish, we can use a given number of words to make a statement or ask a
question by the way in which we order the words and use inflection.
Simply stated, placing the words in the correct order is applied gram-
mar.
The issue is not whether or not you need to know English grammar.
English is unintelligible without it. The question is, "How will you
learn English grammar best?" I think you will learn English grammar
better and faster by learning it as a spoken language.
The best time to study grammar
In Chapter 1, I said that effective spoken English instruction simulta-
neously trains all of your cognitive and sensory centers of speech.
When is the best time to learn that the sentence, "That is a book," is an
English statement, and the sentence, "Is that a book?" is an English
question? The best time is when you simultaneously learn to speak
these two sentences. That would take place while you are learning
many other similar sentences so that you will develop a cognitive sense
reinforced by motor skill and auditory feedback. You will learn that the
order and inflection of the one sentence is a question, while the other is
a statement. The sound of the sentence is as much an indicator of its
meaning as its written form. Right? Right!
There is also a relationship between good pronunciation and good
spelling. I am a poor speller. I understand that I misspell many words
because I probably mispronounce them. At some point, everyone who
expects to write English well must learn to spell. Yet, it will probably
be faster for you to learn good spelling after learning good pronuncia-
tion than it will be for you to learn good spelling without being able to
speak. In practice, you will learn the spelling of new English words as
they are added to the vocabulary of each new lesson.
I am not saying that grammar or spelling are unnecessary. Rather, I
am saying that grammar can be taught more effectively—and in less
time—by using audio language drills. Teaching grammar by means of
spoken language has the great advantage of reinforcing the cognitive
learning of grammar while using two additional functions found in nor-
mal speech—motor skill feedback and auditory feedback. Teaching
20 Learning Spoken English
grammar as a written exercise does develop cognitive learning, but it
reinforces it with visual feedback.
Though visual feedback has some merit, it is outside the context of
spoken English. The single reinforcement of visual feedback outside of
the spoken English context is far less effective than motor skill feed-
back and auditory feedback which are both inside the spoken language
context. The trade-off is costly and retards progress. Far more is gained
when you learn to identify correct grammar by the way a sentence
sounds, rather than by the way it looks. Though it would not typically
be explained this way, it is also important on a subconscious level that
you learn how correct grammar feels. As a function of the propriocep-
tive sense, a statement produces a certain sequence of sensory feedback
from the mouth, tongue, and air passages that feels different than a
question.
It would take considerably longer to teach a language student how to
write English grammar exercises, and then speak English correctly, than
it would to teach the same student to first speak English correctly, and
then introduce rules of grammar. This gain would be greatly aug-
mented, however, if the rules of grammar were incorporated into the
spoken language lessons themselves as they are in Spoken English
Learned Quickly.
If you study spoken English for a year, you will gain a great deal of
fluency. With that spoken English fluency, you will have a good under-
standing of English grammar. If you spend the same amount of time in
English grammar study, you will have limited English fluency and will
have little practical understanding of English grammar.
That is probably why you are reading this book. You have undoubt-
edly studied written English for a long time, but you still can't speak
English very well.
Your perceived needs as you begin studying English will signifi-
cantly influence how you answer this chapter's title question. If you
decide that you need beginning English when you start your study, you
will spend much time looking for lessons with beginning sentences be-
cause English does not speak a beginning language. On the other hand,
if you decide that the English used in the daily newspaper is what you
want to learn, you can easily find that kind of English language.
Is there a need for beginning and advanced lessons in English?
I am really asking if beginning and advanced students can use the
same level of lessons to learn spoken English. Before you give an intui-
tive answer, I need to ask the question properly. The question is, "Does
English have multiple, specialized language divisions?"
The answer is, "No, it does not." There is no high English language
spoken by the gentry versus a low language spoken by commoners. His-
torically, many languages such as Greek and Chinese, have indeed used
two levels. Modern English does not even have a specialized construc-
tion for folklore. Many languages in which oral tradition has been
Chapter Summary: Without first evaluating the unique qualities
of language, it is often assumed that English study must be di-
vided into beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels.
However, a careful assessment of English indicates that it does
not use multiple levels of language complexity.
The kind of sentences which you use as a beginning student
are the same kind of sentences which you must master as an ad-
vanced student in order to gain English fluency. As a beginning
English student, you must learn English in the context of full sen-
tences. As an advanced student, you must use the same sentences
to perfect syntax and intonation.
Chapter 4: Do You Need Beginning and Advanced Lessons?
22 Learning Spoken English
preserved have a storytelling form of the language which is distinct
from the language used in everyday conversation. In these languages,
there are often specialists who recount folktales in public gatherings.
Common English has none of that.
In fact, English is so simple in this regard that we do not even have
two forms of address for people of differing social standing. French, for
instance, has strict conventions regarding the use of "tu" or "vous"
when addressing someone. A U.S. citizen, however, would address both
the President of the United States and a young child as "you."
English has many specialized vocabularies. Any student who has
taken courses in anatomy, law, physics, automotive technology, psy-
chology, engineering, geology, or anthropology has spent a great deal
of time learning specialized terminology. But the essential English syn-
tax which holds these words together in a sentence is still the language
of the street—or the language of the daily newspaper.
So, aside from specialized vocabularies, English has no divisions
representing varying levels of language complexity. Almost any indi-
vidual with at least a secondary school education would make essen-
tially the same evaluation of another speaker's ability to use good or
bad English.
The exception to the above paragraph would be found in technical
documents such as legal briefs and the like. However, this style of Eng-
lish is far from the language used in normal conversation.
There is only one kind of English which you need to learn. You do
not need two or more different course levels. This is not to say that
English is a simple language to learn. Far from it. However, the same
complexity is in all spoken English, not merely in some higher level.
Why have traditional language programs insisted that there must be
beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels of English study? It is not
because there are beginning and advanced levels of spoken English. It
is because there are beginning, intermediate, and advanced explanations
for English grammar. This means that some rules of English grammar
are easy to explain. Some rules of grammar are more difficult to ex-
plain. And some are complex enough to require a highly technical ex-
planation. But spoken English is one subject of study, whereas the for-
mal rules of English grammar are quite another.
Now I can answer the question, "Do you need beginning and ad-
vanced English lessons to learn the language?" Of course not. There is
Do You Need Beginning and Advanced Lessons? 23
only one level of spoken English. If you are a beginning student, you
must start by speaking normal English sentences. If you have studied
English for several years and consider yourself an advanced student,
you must continue until you are able to fluently pronounce the words in
those same normal English sentences.
There will be a great difference in the fluency between beginning
and advanced students. But there is no difference in the level of English
sentences they must study. They must use the same English sentences
both to initiate, and then to master, the process which will develop the
necessary cognitive, motor, and auditory skills used to speak fluent
English.
Complex English sentences
I need to add an explanation so that what I am saying is understand-
able. English grammar identifies simple sentences (sentences with one
main clause), compound sentences (sentences with two or more main
clauses), complex sentences (sentences with one main clause and at
least one subordinate clause), and compound-complex sentences
(sentences made up of two or more main clauses and at least one subor-
dinate clause). An example of a compound-complex sentence would
be, "The Saturday afternoon program was like a two-ring circus; while
one part of the TV screen carried the professional football game, the
other part showed scores from collegiate games." Of course, this is not
a sentence we would expect beginning English students to use. But the
complexity of the sentence is not in the language level of the sentence.
Its so-called complexity is only in the punctuation of the sentence
which makes it a complex sentence by grammatical definition. With
very little change, the sentence could become three simple sentences:
"The Saturday afternoon program was like a two-ring circus. One part
of the TV screen showed the professional football game. The other part
of the TV screen showed scores from collegiate games." Aside from
vocabulary, any one of these three sentences are beginning level sen-
tences.
Thus, when I say that there is no difference in the level of English
sentences a beginning and advanced student must study, I am not talk-
ing about a grammatical definition. I am saying that there is not one
language that would be used by commoners and another that would be
used by the gentry. Even though the example sentence about the TV's
split screen is not a sentence we would want to include in the first les-
son, it does not represent multiple, specialized language divisions.
24 Learning Spoken English
But it's too difficult to start with normal English
Not really. Once you understand the "hello"s and "goodby"s in Eng-
lish, you are ready to begin practicing with normal sentences. Aside
from sentences which contain specialized vocabulary, most English
sentences use common verbs and syntax construction. This is the Eng-
lish you want to speak. Use it from the very start of your language
study.
This is not as difficult as it seems. If you are using the Spoken Eng-
lish Learned Quickly course, you will discover that Lesson 1 uses nor-
mal English sentences, even though it uses only the present tense. Les-
son 2 uses complete sentences in past, present, and future tenses. The
sentences become slightly more complex as the lessons progress, but
every sentence in the entire course is one that you will need to master as
an "advanced" student. Your objective in using Spoken English
Learned Quickly is not merely to understand the sentence as though it
was part of a grammar exercise. Your objective is to be able to use
each sentence in fluent English speech.
The spoken language you want to learn is everyday English. It will
remove a great deal of stress if you realize that in the very first week of
English study, you are learning normal English. By and large, your
English study will never become any more difficult than it is when you
first begin because you will be studying normal spoken English from
the first lesson to the completion of your formal study.
This is how you will study English with Spoken English Learned
Quickly. It was designed for both beginning and advanced students
because our students want to learn spoken English, not written English
grammar.
Chapter 5: Selecting a Text
In this chapter, I am using the term text to identify a written manu-
script. A newspaper in English is usually an excellent source for a
study text. Most newspapers use good syntax, relatively simple sen-
tences, and common expressions. In addition to general vocabulary,
newspapers will give you many common political, scientific, economic,
and technical words. Generally, newspapers are also a good source of
colloquial expressions.
As you begin language study, you will need both a manuscript and
an audio recording of the text for pronunciation practice. In your initial
selection of a study text, you will be faced with a choice between a
printed text from a newspaper or spoken language from a radio broad-
cast.
I will explain the use of a newspaper as an English text in this chap-
ter because it will help you to understand how the text would be used.
However, if you are using the Spoken English Learned Quickly les-
sons, the text and the audio recordings are complete and all of the fea-
tures in this chapter are already built into that course.
Fourteen of the 16 Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons begin
with a Lesson Text section. This material may be read aloud exactly
like a newspaper. If you are using the Lesson Text for your reading,
Chapter Summary: For spoken English study, you will need
both a written text and an audio recording of that text. It will be
easier to make an audio recording using a newspaper text than it
will be to transcribe a radio audio program as a written text.
The newspaper article becomes an excellent text for language
study.
If you are using Spoken English Learned Quickly, both the
text and the audio recordings have already been prepared for you.
you will have the added advantage of familiar vocabulary and audio
recordings to guide your pronunciation. You may also print each Les-
son Text from the downloadable section of the website.
After you complete the Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons,
you will still want to read newspapers as you continue studying Eng-
lish. You can become very fluent in English—and develop an excellent
vocabulary—if you continue to read English newspapers aloud. How-
ever, at that point you would not need to make audio recordings. Read-
ing aloud and keeping a vocabulary notebook would be all you would
need to do. By this time in your study, I am assuming that your pronun-
ciation and voice inflection would be acceptable. If not, you would
need to return to the Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons until
your pronunciation was correct.
Going from a written text to an audio recording
In this chapter, I am merely describing the text itself. For the mo-
ment, I will assume that you would have a teacher who is a first lan-
guage English speaker. I am also assuming that you would have audio
recording equipment.
By now you realize that the purpose of using the newspaper is spo-
ken language practice. You would always read the newspaper aloud,
and would frequently read a sentence aloud and then look away from
the text, repeating the sentence from recall memory.
Everything considered, you would probably find it easier to produce
an audio recording from a newspaper text than you would to produce a
text from a radio broadcast recording. It would be much simpler to
have your English teacher record the text than to have the teacher tran-
scribe the audio recording.
For your study purposes, a printed newspaper text would assure a
more precise use of the language, better spelling, and a more easily pre-
served printed copy. Because live radio broadcasts are difficult to re-
cord with inexpensive audio equipment, you would likely have diffi-
culty hearing all of the words. Therefore, it would be easier to get a
good text and a usable recording by having the teacher read a newspa-
per text for the audio recording. The text would be recorded so that
there would be adequate pauses for your study.
26 Learning Spoken English
Selecting a Text 27
Using the newspaper for vocabulary
First, read the article out loud, identifying new vocabulary as you
read. Whenever you read a word you do not know, stop and find it in
your dictionary. Keep a vocabulary notebook. If a word you do not
know is used more than twice in an article, put a check ( ) by it for
special study. However, do not check names of places or people. After
you finish reading the article for the first time, review the meaning of
all of the new vocabulary words. Study these words enough so that you
know what they mean when you read the article. Always pronounce
vocabulary words—do even your vocabulary study out loud.
After you are more familiar with the process, select other newspaper
articles and continue reading aloud while you look for new vocabulary
words. When you find a word in a second newspaper article which you
have already checked ( ) in your notebook, place a second check
( ) by it. Any word in your notebook with two checks should be
memorized as an important word to know.
Whenever you are able to do so, write cognate forms of the same
word. For example, to adhere, an adhesive, and adhesion are cognates.
It will be helpful for you to learn multiple cognate forms of a word at
the same time rather than learning each form as a new vocabulary word
when you encounter it. Association of a single word in multiple forms
with one root meaning will result in more rapid vocabulary retention. It
will also teach you how to develop cognate forms of words as you
speak English in the future.
Verbs should be listed in your notebook by their infinitive form (for
example, "to remember") rather than by a conjugated form (for exam-
ple, "she remembers"). After mastering the verb's conjugation, it will
be far simpler to learn a single verb form than it will be to attempt to
learn each form of a verb as an individual vocabulary word.
Spoken English Learned Quickly does an excellent job of teaching
English verbs. Since you will learn each new verb in all its persons,
tenses, and specialized forms, you will learn the English verb so well
that you will be able to use every tense and person of any regular Eng-
lish verb. If you heard a new English verb, you would be able to use
every person and tense in a spoken sentence even if you did not know
that verb's meaning.
Using the newspaper for meaning
Read the article again for meaning. Always read aloud. If you do
not understand a sentence, stop and figure out exactly what it means.
If some of the definitions you have written in your notebook do not
make sense in the context of the article, find the word again in your
dictionary and see if it has other meanings. If a second meaning for
the word would make better sense, write that definition in your note-
book.
If you still cannot figure out the meaning of a sentence, it may be
because two or more words are used together as a single expression.
Try to determine the meaning of expressions. Look for similar expres-
sions in other articles. If you still cannot determine the meaning of an
expression, ask your English teacher for assistance.
Review your vocabulary meanings regularly with your English
teacher.
Using the newspaper for syntax development
Reading a newspaper article aloud is an ideal way to reinforce your
use of grammatically correct English syntax. Your goal is to retrain
your mind, hearing, and mouth to understand and use English cor-
rectly. Reading aloud from a newspaper is one of the best ways to
accomplish that.
The great advantage is that you will be reading a large number of
different sentences which will all be organized according to the same
grammar rules. Thus, you would be learning the acceptable range of
the syntax of that language. That is, there may appear to be many
variations from sentence to sentence, yet all of the uses would still be
correct. For an example, you would learn that you can place the word
"however" at the beginning, middle, or end of an English sentence.
You would also learn that the position of "however" can make a slight
difference in meaning, or it can enhance the style of the sentence.
In many respects, using the newspaper for syntax development is
similar to using it for fluency enhancement and as an aid in conversa-
tion as mentioned below. The same exercises suggested below would
be as profitable for syntax as they would be for fluency and conversa-
tion.
28 Learning Spoken English
Selecting a Text 29
Using the newspaper in order to learn expressions
Expressions add richness to all languages. Identify expressions as
you read the newspaper. Use a special mark to identify them in articles.
Many expressions may be divided so that component words of the ex-
pression are separated by non-component words.
Try substituting other words while using the same expression. Say or
write as many sentences using the expression as possible. To use an
example, you may read a sentence in a newspaper which says, "The
Governor announced Friday that he will not run for another term, put-
ting to rest months of speculation about his future intentions." Most ex-
pressions can be used in different tenses with different people or things.
For example, the expression "to put to rest" can be used in the present,
"I want to put our disagreement to rest," in the future, "He will put his
argument to rest," or in the past, "They finally put their rivalry to rest."
Notice that in the last phrase, the component parts of the expression are
separated: "They finally put their rivalry to rest."
To continue with another illustration, English uses word forms as a
type of expression. For example, you may read a sentence in a newspa-
per which says, "We're getting all kinds of calls from people who are
panicking and asking what they can do." This form of expression uses
two or more words ending in "…ing" to describe two or more actions
that the same person is doing at one time.
Using the newspaper for fluency enhancement
In this use of the newspaper, you would simply read rather than al-
ternating between reading and repeating a sentence from recall memory.
You would want to read the entire article aloud for fluency practice. Try
reading the article as smoothly as possible without stopping. Read it
aloud at least twice.
For more fluency practice, continue reading the article aloud until
you can read it at the same rate of speed that an American speaker uses
when talking. Practice until your pronunciation duplicates that of the
American speaker.
Your purpose would not merely be to learn the vocabulary in these
newspaper articles, but to learn to speak fluently. Keep practicing until
you can read the article aloud so that an American speaker could clearly
understand what you are saying.
Fluency is the ability to speak smoothly with proper intonation. Ini-
tially use single sentences for fluency drills, repeatedly reading a single
sentence until you can read it smoothly. Eventually, do the same with
multiple sentences or paragraphs. Even as a beginning student, there is
value in reading a longer passage or entire article without break in order
to establish the rhythm of the spoken language. This is excellent pro-
prioceptive training.
Your natural tendency will be to move on to new articles too
quickly. In reality, it would only be after you already know all of the
vocabulary and can pronounce each word correctly that you would be
ready to use the newspaper article to full advantage. You would not be
fully retraining you mind and tongue until you could read the article at
normal speaking speed with proper inflection and pronunciation. You
would accomplish more in attaining fluent speech by re-reading fewer
articles aloud perfectly than you would by reading many articles aloud
with faulty pronunciation.
Using the newspaper for conversation practice
In Chapter 2 I said, "You must never make a mistake when you are
speaking." That objective will be the most difficult when you first be-
gin free conversation. However, using a newspaper article will be a
great aid in producing conversation which is essentially free of mis-
takes.
A newspaper article can give you a great deal of structure for con-
versation practice. This structure would give both you and your Eng-
lish teacher a defined group of vocabulary words, defined sentences
with an understood meaning, and a defined context in which the vo-
cabulary and sentences can be communicated. Your English teacher
could use the newspaper article to structure free conversation.
To continue with the illustration, your English teacher could lead
you in a discussion stemming from a newspaper article. You could eas-
ily have the following discussion after only four weeks of full-time lan-
guage study. Notice that your teacher would ask each question twice,
expecting that you will substitute a pronoun in the second response.
English teacher: "What did the Governor announce Friday?"
Your response: "The Governor announced Friday that he will not run
for another term."
30 Learning Spoken English
Selecting a Text 31
English teacher: "What did the Governor announce Friday?"
Your response: "He announced Friday that he will not run for another
term."
English teacher: "Will the Governor run for another term?"
Your response: "No, the Governor will not run for another term."
English teacher: "Will the Governor run for another term?"
Your response: "No, he will not run for another term."
English teacher: "When did the Governor announce that he will not
run for another term?"
Your response: "The Governor announced Friday that he will not run
for another term."
English teacher: "When did the Governor announce that he will not
run for another term?"
Your response: "He announced Friday that he will not run for another
term."
Assuming that you had only been studying English for four weeks,
your initial response to each question would be halting. You would
also be looking at the printed text when your English teacher initially
asked the question. But at least your answer would be word perfect—
you would be training your proprioceptive sense by using perfect syn-
tax. Now you would want to add perfect pronunciation and fluency to
that.
During typical English instruction, extra attention is usually given to
poor performance. That is, when you use a sentence incorrectly, it is
corrected with additional drills. On the other hand, when you respond
correctly, the teacher moves on to the next sentence. That is not what
you would want your English teacher to do for you now. Of course,
you would want help with incorrect syntax and pronunciation. But in
order to learn the language effectively, you would want to emphasize
correct language use. To continue our example, say that none of the
sentences in the above illustration would contain any phonemes which
you could not reproduce acceptably. Therefore, your English teacher
would continue to drill you on these same sentences until you pro-
nounce them perfectly.
She would again ask the first question twice, allowing you to re-
spond accordingly.
English teacher: "What did the Governor announce Friday?"
Your response: "The Governor announced Friday that he will not run
for another term."
English teacher: "What did the Governor announce Friday?"
Your response: "He announced Friday that he will not run for another
term."
Now, however, you would not be looking at the text. Your English
teacher would ask these two questions until you could answer word per-
fectly from recall memory.
But she would still not be finished. She would now increase her
tempo and would expect you to answer accordingly. She would persist
until the two of you were conversing so quickly and naturally that if an
American came into the room, he or she would hear a strange redundant
conversation in what would otherwise be completely understandable
English. It would be just as understandable to that English speaker as
any conversation between two Americans in a grocery store.
This would continue—maybe for several days of practice—until the
entire series of questions from that newspaper article could be asked
and answered in fully fluent conversation.
You would be worn out by the time you had finished studying this
intensely from a newspaper article. Yet, while others would be in the
beginning language course after their initial four weeks of study, you—
after your first four weeks—would already be speaking on an advanced
level, even though you would only be using a relatively small number
of sentences.
Congratulations!
Using Spoken English Learned Quickly
The Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons are designed exactly
like the newspaper illustration described above. There is both a text
and enough recorded audio lessons so that you would be able speak
English for two hours each day, five days a week, for nine months.
However, because you would have the recorded audio lessons, after you
understood each new exercise, you would do all of your practice with
your text closed.
32 Learning Spoken English
Selecting a Text 33
Spoken English Learned Quickly was designed for students who do
not have a first language English-speaking teacher. You would be able
to do all of your study alone. However, if you are taking an English
class using this course, your teacher should be able to use questions and
answers with you in the same way illustrated in this chapter.
If your teacher is not a first language English speaker, then most of
your time should be spent studying with the recorded Spoken English
Learned Quickly lessons—it should not be spent in English grammar
lessons. You have already studied enough English grammar in school.
Spoken English Learned Quickly was designed so that you can learn to
speak English as quickly as possible. Grammar lessons would only
slow you down.
Our promise to you
As you know, Spoken English Learned Quickly may be freely
downloaded from the website www.FreeEnglishNow.com. We charge
no money for the course, so we are not trying to "sell" you anything.
However, if you will study for two hours each day as described above,
and if you will study using the four rules described in Chapter 2, you
will quickly learn to speak good English.
If you have never studied English before, in four months you will be
able to have a simple English conversation with any American. If you
have already taken two years of English instruction in school and still
cannot speak English well, in four months you will be speaking under-
standable—though simple—English. If you study for two hours a day
for nine months using Spoken English Learned Quickly, you will be
able to speak good English.
However, you must avoid a mistake too many students make. These
students try to move too quickly and quit studying Spoken English
Learned Quickly too soon. They study a lesson until they understand
the meaning of the sentences and the vocabulary. Then they go to the
next lesson. You must remember, these are not lessons in English
grammar or vocabulary. These are lessons in spoken English. You
have not finished a lesson until you can pronounce every sentence so
perfectly—without reading from a text—that an American would think
you were from the United States. Of course, we expect that you would
make it more interesting for yourself by going to a new lesson, and then
coming back and reviewing a previous lesson. But you must always
remember, perfect pronunciation, perfect use of the English verb, and
perfect intonation is your goal before you are finished with a lesson.

Chapter 6: Studying the English Verb
Probably nothing marks someone struggling to learn English quite as
much as improper use of the English verb's person and tense. There-
fore, as you study English, you will want to emphasize learning to use
the verb correctly as you speak. This will require specialized English
verb drills.
Spoken English Learned Quickly places great emphasis on the Eng-
lish verb. In all but the first lesson, you will have special spoken drills
which will help you learn to use the English verb correctly in all its per-
sons and tenses.
A short introduction to verb drills
I started my French language instruction in a grammar-based course.
As I related earlier, I then moved to a school which emphasized spoken
French. During my initial study, I was frustrated by learning only the
present tense of a verb, then a week or two later learning its past tense
or future tense, only to come back to the same verb later to learn its
subjunctive form. It would have been much more effective if I had
learned each verb as a complete unit. The verb "etre" (to be) evolved
into at least four verbs; first I learned the present tense, later the past
tense, still later the future tense, and finally, an entirely new verb called
the subjunctive. It would have been much more effective for me to
Chapter Summary: Learning to use the English verb correctly
will be one of the most difficult tasks for you in learning to speak
fluent English. We suggest that it will be much easier for you if
you simultaneously learn all persons and tenses of each new Eng-
lish verb.
Spoken English Learned Quickly includes four kinds of spo-
ken verb drills to help you learn the English verb quickly and
correctly.
have learned one verb as a unit having four tenses than to have learned
four separate tenses as though each was a new verb.
Of course, I am exaggerating. Yet, if you learn every tense and per-
son of each new verb simultaneously, it becomes a far simpler memory
task. In addition, achieving full use of each verb as it is learned gives
greater initial command of a language. I said many things incorrectly
for many months until I finally learned how to use the subjunctive.
Then I wasted additional time retraining my mind in learning to use the
subjunctive in place of the tenses I had previously thought I was using
correctly. I spent more time learning and unlearning incorrect verb
constructions than had I learned fewer verbs initially, but learned them
in their entirety.
There is, however, another equally forceful argument for learning all
forms of the verb at one time. As I have taught the Spoken English
Learned Quickly course, I have discovered that, in a relative few weeks
of learning all new verbs in their entirety, an adult student with no pre-
vious English study is able to conjugate verbs which they have never
before encountered. I have experimented with this many times. I
choose an obscure regular verb and find a student who does not know
its meaning. Then I have the student conjugate it in all its persons and
tenses as a spoken drill. Only after they have successfully conjugated it
do I tell them what it means. It is an amazing process to see.
Spoken English Learned Quickly was designed to be used as a self-
study course. Most students study on their own. However, I have often
conducted a weekly two-hour group session as a means of encouraging
the students. It is during the group sessions that I have used these spo-
ken conjugation drills.
I strongly encourage you to learn all forms of each verb the first time
you encounter it in your English study. The verb will become much
more useful to you in a shorter period of time. The Spoken English
Learned Quickly course contains very useful English verb drills.
In traditional English language instruction, once a particular verb
tense is supposedly learned, then it is assumed that the students know
that form and no longer need to review it. Yes, the students may be
able to write the present tense forms for many regular verbs. But that is
not the objective. Can they use all of those forms in spontaneous spo-
ken English? In Spoken English Learned Quickly we do not stop the
instruction merely because our students are able to write the endings of
certain verbs. Our goal is to help the students reach a level of fluency
36 Learning Spoken English
Studying the English Verb 37
in which they can use verbs in all of their tenses and persons correctly
in normal speech.
That will also be your objective as you learn to speak English. Do
not be satisfied by simply learning verb tenses and persons in written
form. You do not know a verb until you can use it fluently in spontane-
ous conversation.
In the Spoken English Learned Quickly course, we try to follow the
same pattern with other types of English words. It is far easier to learn
big, bigger, and biggest, or angry, angrier, angriest, and angrily as cog-
nate groups than it is to learn them as individual vocabulary words. Not
only is it easier to remember bad, worse, worst, and badly as a group,
but their meaning is better understood because they are logically related
to each other. The greatest advantage, however, is that this method
teaches students how the English language is developed. When stu-
dents know big, bigger, and biggest, they can then develop the word
tallest if they know only the word tall. The real essence of language
fluency is understanding that language well enough to intuitively use
new vocabulary during actual conversation.
All of the above comments relate to spoken language. You may find
it helpful to organize words in table form. But you must learn to use
the words in the context of spoken language, not merely written tables.
Four types of verb drills
In the Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons we use four verb
table formats. All verb tables are used as spoken English drills with
recorded audio. In the early lessons, we use only the following format
which I will call an "A" format verb drill:
1. An "A" format English verb drill.
TO CALL (to call) / He promised to call. (He promised to call.)
Call. (Call.) / Please call. (Please call.)
calling (calling) / It is calling. (It is calling.)
called (called) / it is called (it is called) / it was called (it was
called) / it will be called (it will be called)
• I call (I call) / he calls (he calls) / she calls (she calls) / it
calls (it calls) / you call (you call) / we call (we call) / they
call (they call)
• I called (I called) / he called (he called) / she called (she
called) / it called (it called) / you called (you called) / we
called (we called) / they called (they called)
• I will call (I will call) / he will call (he will call) / she will call
(she will call) / it will call (it will call) / you will call (you will
call) / we will call (we will call) / they will call (they will call)
Since all of our exercises are recorded audio lessons, you would re-
spond by repeating the words inside parentheses. We provide a 450-
page Student Workbook which contains the written text for all spoken
drills. The parenthetical phrases are included in the written text. Thus,
the narrator says, "to call" and you would respond, "to call." The narra-
tor says, "He promised to call." and you would respond, "He promised
to call." Everything is spoken, and as soon as you would understand a
new exercise, you would put the written text aside and complete the
exercise by using only the audio recording without the text.
Repeated use of this format is what allows our students to conjugate
an unknown verb correctly. Can you see the fluency they have acquired
when they can correctly use English verbs so early in their language
learning experience? That is the same fluency you will want to develop
as you study English.
Quite early in the lesson series, we use another verb table format.
Throughout our Student Workbook, all irregular verb forms are written
in bold type. A drill for the irregular verb "to meet" looks like this:
2. A sentence completion English verb drill.
Complete the following sentences with " . . . them here every evening."
I always meet . . . (I always meet them here every evening.) / He always
meets . . . (He always meets them here every evening.) / You always
meet . . . (You always meet them here every evening.) / We always
meet . . . (We always meet them here every evening.) / They always
meet . . . (They always meet them here every evening.)
Complete the following sentences with " . . . them here after work."
I always met . . . (I always met them here after work.) / She always met
. . . (She always met them here after work.) / You always met . . . (You
always met them here after work.) / We always met . . . (We always
38 Learning Spoken English
Studying the English Verb 39
met them here after work.) / They always met . . . (They always met
them here after work.)
Complete the following sentences with " . . . them all before evening."
I will meet . . . (I will meet them all before evening.) / She will meet .
. . (She will meet them all before evening.) / You will meet . . . (You
will meet them all before evening.) / We will meet . . . (We will meet
them all before evening.) / They will meet . . . (They will meet them
all before evening.)
Though the sentences are simple, this format teaches the verb con-
jugation in the context of the spoken language. It also forces the stu-
dents to be more mentally alert during the exercise. Later in the Spo-
ken English Learned Quickly lessons, we add a third type of verb
table which I am identifying here as a "B" format table. It looks like
this:
3. "B" format English verb drill.
TO TEST (to test) / He promised to test it. (He promised to test it.)
Test. (Test.) / Please test it. (Please test it.)
testing (testing) / He is testing some. (He is testing some.)
tested (tested) / it is tested (it is tested) / it was tested (it was
tested) / it will be tested (it will be tested)
I test (I test) I tested (I tested) I will test (I will
test)
he tests (he tests) he tested (he tested) he will test (he
will test)
she tests (she tests) she tested (she tested) she will test
(she will test)
it tests (it tests) it tested (it tested) it will test (it will
test)
you test (you test) you tested (you tested) you will test
(you will test)
we test (we test) we tested (we tested) we will test (we
will test)
they test (they test) they tested (they tested) they will test
(they will test)
In this format, we force the students to move from tense to tense us-
ing the same person, rather than from person to person using the same
tense as we did in the A format drills. Language requires both skills, so
we teach the students to do both at normal conversation speed.
However, by this time in the lessons we want the students to be able
to do both. Consequently, we alternate between table formats in the
same exercise. That is, the first verb is given using the A format, the
second verb using the B format, the third verb using the A format, the
fourth using the B format, and so on to the end of the exercise. This
increases the students' ability to use the verb with all tenses and persons
while, at the same time, forcing them to develop spontaneity while us-
ing the verb.
Again, this will be your objective in learning English. You want to
be able to manipulate spoken verbs quickly and accurately between all
persons and tenses. You should also be able to see the great advantage
in learning the entire verb with all its tenses and persons at one time. If
you learn all the forms of the entire verb each time you encounter a new
verb, you have learned one meaning with multiple forms rather than a
mix of verb forms and meanings. Learning all the forms of a single
verb this way will take you less time than learning the same material
using a traditional method.
Most importantly, if you use spoken exercises as a means of learning
verb tables, you will find that the conjugation you are learning for one
verb will be quickly transferred to other verbs.
In Spoken English Learned Quickly, you will always study the verb
using a spoken exercise without reading from the text after you are fa-
miliar with that exercise.
We use a final verb exercise format in the Spoken English Learned
Quickly course. That exercise with its spoken introductory explanation
looks like this:
40 Learning Spoken English
Studying the English Verb 41
4. Tense- or person-selection English verb drill.
"Say each sentence using the word I will give you. I will tell you if the
sentence should be in the present, the past, or the future. Use the word
'to take.'"
Present. The children in that family always _________ the bus.
(The children in that family always take the bus.) The children in that
family always take the bus. (The children in that family always take the
bus.)
Present. That family with three children always _________ the bus.
(That family with three children always takes the bus.) That family with
three children always takes the bus. (That family with three children
always takes the bus.)
This verb table format is used frequently throughout the lessons with
a large number of regular and irregular verbs. It uses all tenses and per-
sons and incorporates as much vocabulary from each new lesson as pos-
sible.
The Proprioceptive Influence
Notice how our emphasis on the proprioceptive sense in language
learning has influenced our method. Verb use is important in English.
In order to use the verb properly, the speaker must use tense and person
correctly.
However, tense and person have multiple components. There are
cognitive components which are essentially controlled by memory. So
we need to construct drills which retrain memory. This is accomplished
using a great deal of repetition—these verb forms will be repeated thou-
sands of times throughout these lessons.
During cognitive learning, however, we also want our students to
develop the proprioceptive sense which will retrain their mouths to pro-
nounce the words correctly. After all, the difference in deciding be-
tween "take" and "takes" is a function of pronunciation as far as the
tongue and hearing are concerned. Therefore, in all of these exercises,
we have simultaneously retrained the students' cognitive skills, proprio-
ceptive sense, and hearing by forcing them to speak aloud, listening to
both the narrator and their own voice, and experiencing the feedback
from their own mouth as they speak.
We have also done something else in Spoken English Learned
Quickly which would be extremely important for you. Everything you
heard the narrator say would be perfect English. It is perfect in both its
pronunciation and syntax. You could use these lessons for two hours a
day for five days a week. If you would repeat exactly what the narrator
says, you could speak perfect English for 10 hours during that week,
even though you were studying by yourself.
Of course, you could probably do a written exercise using the same
material. It would be a cognitive exercise, but it would not involve any
retraining of your mouth or hearing. You would probably work on it
for two hours or less during the week. The results would be negligible
in terms of teaching you to speak English fluently.
However, studying English the way we are suggesting will be diffi-
cult. There is no way that you can repeat the same sentences enough
times to retrain your mind, mouth, and hearing without becoming weary
in the process. That is the price you must be willing to pay in order to
efficiently learn to speak English fluently.

Chapter 7: Success in Spoken English Study
You are reading this book because you want to learn to speak fluent
English. I trust it will help you. Most of all, I think our freely
downloadable Spoken English Learned Quickly course on
www.FreeEnglishNow.com will be of benefit to you.
It is the world's most widely used spoken English language course,
and it is helping hundreds of thousands of students around the world
learn English very quickly. If you lived in the United States, for each
hour of study, Spoken English Learned Quickly would help you learn
to speak English twice as fast as you could learn spoken English in a
college English class. However, it is much more difficult to learn to
speak English fluently in a country where English is seldom used. If
you live in a country where you do not regularly hear properly pro-
nounced, grammatically correct English, Spoken English Learned
Quickly could help you learn to speak English in even less than half of
the time it normally takes in your country.
However, even though the course is free on the internet, it will still
cost you a great deal to learn to speak fluent English. It will cost you
time and a great deal of personal discipline. There will also be the cost
of changing your method of studying English. You must stop wasting
your time on English grammar and writing lessons and practice spoken
English instead—even when others tell you that in order to learn to
speak English well, you must study English grammar and writing. (Has
studying English grammar really helped you speak English fluently?)
Chapter Summary: This chapter will encourage you to be per-
sistent in studying spoken English. Staying at the task will be
your greatest difficulty.
This chapter will also encourage you to improve your spoken
English fluency by reading newspapers. The chapter closes by
telling you that you can expect success as you study spoken
English.
44 Learning Spoken English
Why is it free?
Many wonder why Spoken English Learned Quickly is free on the
internet if it is really as good as claimed. Many probably think that I
am trying to sell them something later. The simplest reason that Spo-
ken English Learned Quickly is free is that I want to help people. I
especially want to help those who do not have much money. There is
also a practical reason—it is too expensive for me to pay others to mar-
ket a new product world-wide. Even though I would charge $135 for
the course if I were selling it as a CD, it would be much more expensive
for me to sell the course than it is to give it away free on the internet
because I would have production, marketing, and shipping costs—and
after all of the cost, it would be almost impossible to protect from pirat-
ing.
But there is still another reason why Spoken English Learned
Quickly is free. I know that this new Feedback Training Method is the
best way to learn spoken English. That is true even though it is impos-
sible for me to change the way our universities and colleges teach Eng-
lish in the United States. There is only one way I can show them that
this method is more effective. When hundreds of thousands of students
around the world learn to speak English faster and better with Spoken
English Learned Quickly than they can with any other course, then I
will have proved the point. That is why I want you to be successful in
learning fluent spoken English with Spoken English Learned Quickly.
After only two years on www.FreeEnglishNow.com, Spoken Eng-
lish Learned Quickly became the world's most widely used spoken
English language course. Its worldwide use increases every month be-
cause students are finally learning to speak English so quickly.
Remember the four rules
In order to succeed at learning to speak English fluently, you must
remember the four rules previously given in Chapter 2, plus a new rule
I am adding now:
1. To learn to speak English correctly, you must speak it aloud.
2. To learn to speak English fluently, you must think in English.
3. The more you speak English aloud, the more quickly you will learn to
speak fluently.
4. You must never make a mistake when you are practicing spoken
English.
Success in Spoken English Study 45
Now, let's add Rule number 5:
5. Your success will depend on the amount of time you devote to spoken
English study.
There is no alternative to spending a great amount of time in spoken
English language study. If you are devoting full time to it, then try to
spend a full eight hours a day, five days a week on language study. Ide-
ally, that will be eight hours devoted to actual speaking while using ei-
ther the Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons or reading the news-
paper aloud. If you are enrolled in an English class, you will need to
supplement your class and preparation time with additional newspaper
reading and spoken exercises for a total of eight hours of study each
day.
In all probability, however, you are not studying English full time.
Whatever your schedule permits—from one hour a day to eight hours a
day—bring as much spoken language into your study time as possible.
Be persistent
Lack of persistence is the largest reason why you would fail to learn
fluent spoken English. Though grammar-based study is ineffective, it is
usually easier for a student to do written English grammar assignments
than spoken drills. (Written grammar assignments are also used be-
cause English classes are often too large for spoken language study,
students do not have recorded audio lessons or audio equipment, written
assignments make it look like more was accomplished, and because
English teachers themselves often do not speak English fluently.)
Many Spoken English Learned Quickly students fail because they
assume that when they understand the meaning of all the sentences, and
know the meaning of all of the vocabulary words for a lesson, they have
finished that lesson. You will not succeed, however, until you have
repeated the spoken English exercises frequently enough so that you
can pronounce each sentence exactly like an American. That will take
far more time than merely learning what each sentence means.
Another reason Spoken English Learned Quickly students fail is
because they feel they are too advanced for these lessons. "After all,"
they think, "I have already studied English for two years, and I already
know the meaning of these sentences." They are making the same mis-
take. They are confusing their understanding of grammar with their
ability to speak. I have had these "advanced" students come to one
class and then quit. Yet, they could not speak fluent English. They
46 Learning Spoken English
needed to do the exercises from Spoken English Learned Quickly just
as much as the beginning students, though they probably would have
progressed much more rapidly than others in the class. This is why
Spoken English Learned Quickly is so valuable as a self-study
course—each student can progress at his or her own speed.
In fact, practicing the drills until you can really speak fluent English
will be the most difficult part of these lessons.
But don’t try too hard
You need to be persistent. But trying too hard to learn spoken English can
also hinder your progress.
When you studied for important English exams in school, you worked hard
to memorize grammar rules, you lost sleep in order to study, you worried about
your grade, and you were anxious during the exam. As a result, stress was
often associated with English study.
On the other hand, when you and a friend were talking in your own lan-
guage about a soccer game, you were excited about your favorite team’s vic-
tory. But you were not anxious about the language itself when you were
speaking.
To use this new Feedback Training Method to its full advantage, you must
hear yourself speaking English correctly. If stress accompanies the language
learning process, your spoken English will not be normal.
Be persistent in spending the time necessary to learn spoken English. But
avoid becoming stressed. Whether you are reading a newspaper aloud or re-
peating drills from the Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons, forget that
you are studying English and speak naturally just as if you were talking to a
friend about a soccer game.
Continue reading the newspaper
You will have more time to study spoken English with newspapers
after you finish the Spoken English Learned Quickly course. How-
ever, even while you are studying these lessons, you may add variety by
reading an English newspaper. Always read aloud using full voice vol-
ume.
Then, when you have finished all of the Spoken English Learned
Quickly lessons, you should continue practicing spoken English at least
five days a week. A simple way to do that is to read an English news-
Success in Spoken English Study 47
newspaper aloud for one hour each day. Continue to use a vocabulary
notebook and learn the pronunciation and meaning of new words.
If you are not certain that the English newspapers published in your
country use good English (many do not), then go to the internet to find
newspapers published in English-speaking countries. If you are study-
ing American English, be certain to use newspapers which are actually
published in America in order to get the vocabulary and expressions
you want to study.
You may want to use the following internet sources. You can usu-
ally print newspaper articles from the internet for your study. If the
normal print function on your computer does not work—or if it prints
more than just the article you want—you can drag your mouse over just
what you want to save in order to highlight it, click copy, and then paste
it into a new document on your computer.

Expect success
Learning to speak any new language is a difficult task. But it is not
impossible. The Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons will make it
much easier for you.
However, language learning always seems to move in steps. You
will study for a period of time and then reach a plateau where it seems
as though you are not making further progress. Then, suddenly, you
will realize that you have once more made excellent progress. Then,
for a time, it will again seem as though nothing is happening.
This is a normal process. These stair steps in spoken English fluency
will be much more exaggerated to you than they will be to those who
speak English as their first language. If you are studying diligently, they
will undoubtedly hear regular progress in your ability to speak, even
when you think nothing is happening.
Be persistent! You can learn to speak English fluently if you work
diligently.
48 Learning Spoken English
LEARNING SPOKEN ENGLISH tells you how to learn to speak
English in half the time it would require in even the best
grammar-based English training programs. If you live in a
country where good English is not regularly spoken, for each
hour of study you can learn how to speak in even less than half
the time it will take others in your country.
This entirely new language study method for learning spoken
English works extremely well. It was first introduced on the
website www.FreeEnglishNow.com. Within two years, it had
become the world’s most widely distributed spoken English
language course. Today, hundreds of thousands of students
around the world are learning fluent spoken English using the
Spoken English Learned Quickly lessons from the website.
This book completely explains this new language study
method which is called the Feedback Training Method (also
known as the Proprioceptive Language Learning Method). You
can now learn English—or any other language—faster and with
greater fluency using this new method.
This book will help you learn English more quickly if you are
already studying in another English program. You may also use
the freely downloadable Spoken English Learned Quickly
lessons from www.FreeEnglishNow.com whether you are a
beginner or advanced English student.
We wish you the best of success as you learn to speak fluent
English.
